# Querying data from pandas for local analysis

I'm a big fan of the BigQuery platform, it's powerful, and relatively cheap for what it can do, in fact the first 10GB of storage per month is free along with the first 1 TB of query data processed per month (as of 2020-01-18). In fact it contains a lot of interesting public datasets which can be used, and analysed for practice, the storage costs for these datasets are completely free.

## Setting up the environment

To get started with BigQuery you need to [set up](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/getting-started/) your GCP account. BigQuery has a well-designed web interface, I'd encourage you to get a feel for BigQuery using the web UI and the query editor. The query editor has some [linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) capabilities, as well as a as code validator.
